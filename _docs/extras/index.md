# Extras

Extras include other integrations that aren't relevant to style or customization, but can further enhance your documentation pages. Currently, we have support for adding interactive quizzes.

* [Quizzes](https://github.com/ejniemeijer/ejniemeijer.github.io/tree/740d53572bc4d1014c58a21dbcec9481948e9976/_docs/extras/example-quiz/README.md)

Would you like to see another question type, or another kind of extra? Please \[open an issue\]\)\(/issues/new\).
